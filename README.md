# MRI- AI-brain-segmentation-framework
Open-source AI framework for brain segmentation and abnormality detection

A deep learning-based open-source project focused on segmenting brain regions (gray matter, white matter, ventricles, hippocampus) from MRI scans. Utilizes an ED-U-Net architecture enhanced with Sobel edge detection for improved boundary precision.
